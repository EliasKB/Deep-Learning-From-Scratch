# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch 
# Deep Learning From Scratch In Matlab
## Classification problem by Deep learning with different number of hidden layer (0, 1, 2, 4).
## Forward propagaion, gradient descent using backpropagation to mini batchs.
### Understanding the codes migh requires some understanding of the mathematical terms behind the (back propagation) algorithm.
#### You need the file "LoadMNIST.m" in your folder to be able to uppload the data and run the code-files.
#### The data in "mnist_data" is about hand written digits.
#### To illustrate/see a digit: imshow(reshape(xTrain(:,dataIndex),[28 28])), Where dataIndex= [1, 50000].
